This compassionate resource is designed to support those caring for loved ones affected by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

We understand the challenges you face, and we're here to help you navigate this journey with love and understanding. To use this app, you need to provide an OpenAI API key, which you can get here.

This is a personal project, I cover the costs myself, so if you happen to have an API key, I would deeply appreciate your support in using it.

I understand that generating an API key may seem like an extra step, but itâ€™s quick and easy. Your help means a lot to me and truly contributes to the sustainability of this projectâ€”thank you for being a part of it!
